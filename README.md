## 🌟 **About Me**  

Hi! I’m **Shivam Singh**, a passionate technologist and lifelong learner currently pursuing a **Dual Degree at IIIT Hyderabad**. My journey combines the technical rigor of **Computer Science** with the exploratory depth of **Computational Human Sciences**, where I dive deep into how technology shapes human experiences and well-being.  

My academic interests span a wide spectrum:  
- 💡 **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: Exploring how interfaces and technology influence human behavior, with a focus on fitness and well-being.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning and AI**: Developing models that solve real-world problems while understanding their societal impact.  
- 🛠️ **System Design and Development**: From building robust networking solutions to designing engaging user experiences in game development.  

As a researcher, I’m currently investigating how **fitness technology** impacts perceptions of health, well-being, and body image. This includes exploring the role of **gamification**, **cultural influences**, and **biases in tech**. My work is a mix of building tech, studying its sociological effects, and collaborating with experts to shape meaningful solutions.  

When I’m not coding or diving into research papers, you’ll find me:  
- Sipping on a perfect cup of **coffee** ☕, brainstorming my next project.  
- Enthusiastically following the latest in **F1 racing** 🏎️ and admiring the strategy and precision of motorsport.  
- Geeking out over **sports** 🏀⚽—whether it’s playing, watching, or analyzing the games that inspire me.  

I love connecting with people who share similar passions for **technology**, **sports**, or just creating cool stuff. Feel free to explore my projects, contribute, or just drop a hello—let’s build something amazing together!
